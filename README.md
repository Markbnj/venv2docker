# venv2docker

venv2docker is a bash shell script which packages a python virtualenv into
a docker container. The script supports numerous options for controlling
the content of the image at build time, as well as the behavior of the
container at runtime.

## Why?

It's a good question! Physically migrating your virtualenv into a docker
container is probably not a good way to proceed for production deployments,
where most engineers will wante to freeze pip requirements, recreate the
environment inside a clean image, and then clone the code repository into
it. That gives you a declarative recipe for recreating the runtime
environment, as well as confidence that what was committed to the repo is what
is running in the container.

But, not everyone is running CI/CD in a production stack. Someone may instead
be building a simple Wordpress site in a virtualenv at home, and still wish to
take advantage of the ease of deployment that a containerized application
offers. That use-case, and also just wanting to dig into virtualenv and
understand it better, were enough justification for me to create this program.

## Pre-release

venv2docker is early, pre-release code. The only branch at this time is
master. The script has only been tested in ubuntu 15.10 and debian jessie,
running on bash with python 2.7.5+. I would like to make it more portable,
and there is a lot of work still to be done there.

## Prerequisites

venv2docker requires docker to be installed, of course. If you don't have it
you can [get it here](https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/).

A working python and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
installation is also required.
